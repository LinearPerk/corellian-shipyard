# ============================================================
# Corellian Ships — A LinearPerk Production
# Corellian Engineering Corporation (CEC) YT-Series
# ============================================================
#
# "We build the ship. You make it yours."
#     — CEC Chief Engineer, New Sahara Shipyard
#
# The Corellian Engineering Corporation operates out of a dusty
# shipyard on New Sahara in the Phecda system. The founders — a
# close-knit group who arrived long ago from what they vaguely
# describe as "a system very far away" — brought with them a
# remarkable talent for modular ship design and a stubborn insistence
# on building everything round. No one has located their homeworld
# on any star chart. They change the subject when pressed, though
# they occasionally reference "the old trade routes" and "a war
# that happened a long time ago."
#
# CEC builds hulls and frames only. No outfits, no reactors, no
# weapons. "We could build you a reactor that would make your hair
# stand up, but we can't get the parts. Not in this galaxy." So
# they build the best hulls they can with what's here, and you fit
# them however you like. That's always been the Corellian way.
#
# The YT line traces back to the Prospector — an early prototype
# that never made the production catalog. Most surviving examples
# ended up on the frontier, in the hands of families who worked the
# Dirt Belt asteroid fields for generations, hauling ore in a ship
# older than their children, passing it and its debts from parent
# to child. One such family on New Boston finally gave up the
# business and signed the ship over — along with an 800,000 credit
# mortgage and a bank officer who didn't look up from her screen.
#
# From the Prospector, CEC refined the design into the Cargo
# workhorse, the Trader all-rounder, and the Merchantman heavy
# hauler. When escort contracts needed filling, they stripped a
# Cargo hull to armor plate and turret mounts and called it the
# Ironclad. For customers who wanted speed over survival, the
# Striker followed — atomic engines bolted to a hull so thin that
# CEC warranties explicitly exclude "shield failure events." The
# Vanguard came next: a luxury combat yacht for the kind of
# customer who wants quad proton guns and a wet bar.
#
# Then there's the Fortress. A spherical turret platform with eight
# weapon mounts, a drone bay, and almost no cargo space. So heavily
# armed and so glacially slow that CEC engineers reportedly apologize
# to the engines during final assembly.
#
# The pirate variants — Vagabond and Privateer — are black market
# modifications that CEC officially denies any knowledge of, while
# quietly noting that the hull work is "impressively competent."
#
# CEC builds the ships. LinearPerk built this. You make them yours.

The cheapest hull in CEC's catalog — crew-hungry for its size, with limited weapons and weaker shields than anything else bearing the Corellian name. Comes stock with mining lasers and an asteroid scanner. Most surviving examples end up on the frontier, in the hands of miners and salvagers who value the modular design over polish."
