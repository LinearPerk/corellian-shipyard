	add spaceport `	Around the back of the main yard, past the salvage lots, a handful of disc-shaped hulls sit under tarps. A dealer leans against one of them, arms crossed. "Corellian Engineering builds these on New Sahara. Officially, none of them end up here." He pulls back a tarp to reveal a sleek, modified hull. "The Vagabond's fast and quiet. The Privateer's for boarding work. And the Striker —" he grins "— the Striker's for people who think shields are a lifestyle and hull integrity is someone else's problem."`
